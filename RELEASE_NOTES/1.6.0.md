# Release v1.6.0

Highlights:

- Settings: added `log_to_file` and `autosave_selected_tags`. File logging can be turned on/off at runtime from Settings.
- Logging: default log level is now `warn`; added a panic hook; WARN/ERROR lines are persisted to `log.txt`.
- UI: keyboard navigation and selection in prefix and tag pickers; configurable loading indicator animation.
- Localization: added strings for the new settings (English and Russian).
